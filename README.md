# TeloReader
TeloReader detects all telomere sequences in individual long reads and assemblies. It uses k-mer scoring based on their similarity to a canonical telomere motif in sliding windows. TeloReader can identify sequences ≥16 bp, whether at chromosome ends (terminal) or internally (ITS), in datasets.
